    <string name="help_medio">The severity of the medium is calculated with the application of the list of risk factors: each         factor is counted only once and its computation is 0 or 1, regardless of its probability and         presence in greater or lesser part of the excursion. The assessment of the severity of the medium is         obtains from the correspondence between the score (from 1 to 5) and the amount of selected items         in this section. You can add more factors if you consider it appropriate from the settings section.</string>
    <string name="title_help_itdesp">ITINERARY AND DISPLACEMENT</string>
    <string name="help_itinerario">" Premise: Most of the excursions are composed of sections that would obtain different         valuation in the aspects \"Displacement\" and \"Itinerary\"; however the user needs         a valuation for your excursion.          Criteria to be applied:          For each aspect, the different sections will be evaluated. A section is a part of an excursion         with sufficient entity to be considered an excursion in itself or for its inclusion         or exclusion modify the assessment of that aspect.         The excursion will be rated in each aspect as the highest rated stretch.         The valuation of a section must be that of the predominant terrain in it, admitting isolated steps         up to a point above this graduation. The minimum assessment to be assigned to a         stretch is a minor point that its step of maximum degree.         In Difficulty of Displacement, a section that presents a step of score 4 (use of the hands)         in which an error of the hiker can cause his fall to the emptiness or sliding down the slope,         It will be rated 4 (and therefore the tour also)."</string>
    <string name="help_esfuerzo">" The hours of effective march of an excursion is the sum of the hour calculation for each of         the different sections that compose it. The effort evaluation is obtained from the correspondence         between the score (from 1 to 5) and the time intervals (up to 15 hours)."</string>
